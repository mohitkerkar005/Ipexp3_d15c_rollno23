                <h5 class="card-title" style="font-weight: bold;">Experiences, Achievements, Skills, Strengths, and Weaknesses</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Throughout my time in college, I haven't held any official roles within the council, nor have I taken on formal responsibilities in my class council. Nevertheless, I have assumed an informal leadership role within my division (D15C), particularly when guiding mini-project teams during the third and fourth semesters of the academic year 2023-24. Despite the absence of official titles, I believe my contribution in fostering leadership within the division is noteworthy.

                As for my achievements, I successfully cleared the Elementary and Intermediate Art Examinations and passed both my SSC and HSC exams in 2020 and 2022, respectively. I earned a respectable rank in the MHT-CET exam, which facilitated my admission to VESIT. A highlight of the academic year 2023-24 was my participation in the Vivekini group singing competition, organized by VES School, where my team and I secured first place. Academically, I have maintained a cumulative CGPA of approximately 8.35 up until the fourth semester.

                On the technical front, I am proficient in several programming languages, including C, C++, Java, and Python. I possess solid knowledge of relational databases and can write queries in MySQL. My understanding of data structures is competent, allowing me to work with basic structures such as arrays, stacks, and linked lists. I have a foundational grasp of subjects like Operating Systems, Computer Networks, Theory of Computation, and Computer Organization and Architecture. Moreover, I possess basic knowledge of web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                Apart from technical expertise, I have cultivated other skills. I am adept at drawing, sketching, and painting. I am a competent orator with a firm command of the English language. Leadership is a key trait I embody, and I have demonstrated it on several occasions.

                In terms of strengths, I consider myself approachable, warm, and positive. Honesty and sincerity define my approach to life, and I am always truthful about situations around me. Patience is another virtue, as I have helped academically weaker students succeed. I prioritize teamwork and often journal my thoughts, expressing my perspectives on various events. My ability to engage in meaningful one-on-one conversations and mediate conflicts between individuals further speaks to my interpersonal capabilities.

                However, I also recognize my weaknesses. I struggle to engage larger groups in conversation and lack confidence when representing an entire class. My disinterest in social media often leaves me disconnected from how I am perceived by others. I tend to focus excessively on my own issues, sometimes neglecting to acknowledge others' accomplishments. At this moment, I feel overwhelmed by my current stateâ€”insufficient web development knowledge, limited expertise in data structures, a less-than-ideal CGPA, no council roles, and only a few projects to showcase. Furthermore, I possess limited knowledge of common development software, which is an area that I acknowledge needs improvement.</p>
